# BoBar

A lightweight floating taskbar application launcher for Windows.

> Created by [Bob James AI Dev](https://bobjames.dev/) the [BoBar Toolbar App](https://bobjames.dev/apps/bobar) was buiilt using .NET 10.0 and Windows Forms, with a focus on high-quality icon extraction, shortcut resolution, and user-friendly customization.

## Download BoBar ⬇️
Download the latest alpha release [BoBar-0.1.0.12-alpha-win-x64.zip](https://github.com/bbbjames/BoBar/releases/download/v0.1.0.12-alpha/BoBar-0.1.0.12-alpha-win-x64.zip)

Extract the ZIP file and run `BoBar.exe`.

I use this every day and it's been a great way to quickly launch my most-used applications without cluttering the taskbar. The icon extraction is fantastic - all my apps look crisp and clear, and the drag-and-drop support makes it super easy to add new items. I also love the snap-to-edge feature, it keeps the toolbar neatly tucked away when I'm not using it. Overall, BoBar has become an essential part of my Windows workflow! p.s. it's still in alpha, so expect some rough edges and missing features, but it is stable and very usable.

└── Icons\              # Extracted application icons (PNG format)
    └── *.png
```

### launchitems.json

JSON array containing launch item definitions:

```json
[
  {
    "Name": "Notepad",
    "ExecutablePath": "notepad.exe",
    "Arguments": "",
    "WorkingDirectory": "",
    "IconPath": "C:\\Users\\...\\BoBar\\Icons\\notepad.png",
    "Order": 0
  },
  {
    "Name": "Visual Studio Code",
    "ExecutablePath": "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe",
    "Arguments": "",
    "WorkingDirectory": "",
    "IconPath": "C:\\Users\\...\\BoBar\\Icons\\Code.png",

### Windows Startup

When "Load on Startup" is enabled, BoBar adds an entry to:
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

This setting is per-user and does not require administrator privileges.

### Key Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Form1** | Main UI, button generation, drag-drop, system tray, snap-to-edge |

| **ConfigurationManager** | JSON/INI persistence, default items, AppConfiguration data model |
| **IconExtractor** | Native high-resolution icon extraction from executables |
| **ShortcutResolver** | Windows shortcut (.lnk) file resolution via COM |

### Technical Details

**Icon Extraction System**
- Extracts icons directly from PE resources using Win32 APIs
- Attempts multiple extraction methods for best quality:
  1. Direct PE resource extraction (native sizes, no scaling)
  2. System image lists (SHIL_JUMBO for 256x256, SHIL_EXTRALARGE for 48x48)
  3. ExtractIconEx for embedded icons
  4. SHGetFileInfo as fallback
- Prioritizes largest size and highest color depth (32-bit ARGB)
- Saves as PNG with transparency preservation
- Normalized to 256x256 canvas for consistency

**Shortcut Resolution**
- Uses Windows Shell COM interfaces (IShellLink, IPersistFile)
- Extracts target path, command-line arguments, and working directory
- Validates target exists before adding
- Uses shortcut name as default item name

**Button Separators**
- Dynamically generated Panel controls between buttons
- Styled to match theme (dark/light mode)
- 65% of button height, vertically centered
- Automatically refreshed when buttons change

**Snap-to-Edge**
- Detects when window is within 10px of screen edge
- Automatically aligns to working area (excludes taskbar)
- Works with multiple monitors using `Screen.FromPoint()`

**Theme System**
- Dark mode: `RGB(45, 45, 45)` background
- Light mode: System default colors
- Applies programmatically to all buttons and separators
- Smooth hover and click effects

**Startup Integration**
- Uses `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\...\Run` registry key
- Per-user setting (no admin required)
- Stores absolute path to executable with quotes
- Checkbox reflects current registry state on load

**Change Tracking**
- Tracks adds, edits, removes, reorders in settings dialog
- Prompts on close if unsaved changes exist
- Three-way dialog: Save, Discard, Cancel

## Development

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: .NET 10.0
- **UI**: Windows Forms
- **Language**: C# 14.0 with nullable reference types
- **Serialization**: System.Text.Json
- **Icon Storage**: PNG format (preserves transparency)
- **COM Interop**: Windows Shell for shortcut resolution

### Code Style
- Named event handlers (minimal inline lambdas)
- Programmatic UI generation with dynamic controls
- Null-safe with nullable annotations enabled
- Clean separation of concerns
- Extensive debug logging for icon extraction

### Building for Development

```bash
# Debug build
dotnet build

# Run with console output
dotnet run

# Clean build artifacts
dotnet clean
```

### Testing Workflow

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Run the application
   - Test drag-drop for .exe files
   - Test drag-drop for .lnk shortcuts
   - Verify icon extraction quality

2. **Settings Dialog**
   - Open Settings dialog
   - Add/edit/remove/reorder items
   - Test save prompts (X button, Discard button)
   - Verify JSON persistence

3. **Visual Features**
   - Test theme toggle (dark/light)
   - Verify button separators appear
   - Test animation when adding items
   - Test Always on Top toggle

4. **System Integration**
   - Test system tray behavior
   - Test Load on Startup registry integration
   - Verify window position persistence
   - Test multi-monitor snap-to-edge

5. **Shortcut Support**
   - Drag .lnk files from Start Menu
   - Verify target resolution
   - Test items with arguments
   - Verify working directory handling

## Troubleshooting

### Launch items not persisting
- Check that `%AppData%\BoBar\` directory exists
- Verify write permissions to AppData folder
- Check `launchitems.json` is valid JSON

### Icons not displaying
- Ensure .exe files still exist at their original paths
- Check `%AppData%\BoBar\Icons\` for cached icons (PNG files)
- Try removing and re-adding the item
- Check debug output for icon extraction errors

### Window position not saving
- Check `settings.ini` exists in `%AppData%\BoBar\`
- Verify window was on a visible screen when closed
- Position validation ensures window appears on valid display

### Shortcuts not working
- Verify the shortcut target exists
- Check that the shortcut is a valid .lnk file
- Try creating the shortcut fresh from the Start Menu
- Check debug output for resolution errors

### Startup not working
- Verify registry permissions (shouldn't require admin)
- Check registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- Look for "BoBar" entry with path to executable
- Try unchecking and re-checking the option

### Separators not showing
- Ensure there are at least 2 buttons visible
- Check that theme is applied correctly
- Verify flowLayoutPanel is not suspended
